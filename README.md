## Getting and Cleaning Data - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 


**Introduction**

UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases used in different experiments for analysis of machine learning algorithms, available for use by other researchers. (1) Subject of this analysis is the human activity recognition using smartphones data set, which is result of experiment where observed subjects performed different activities wearing a Samsung Galaxy S2 on their waist. (2)

The goal of our analysis is to build a tidy dataset according given instructions. Human activity recognition is very important domain of machine learning research because of its application in the real world as in medicine (technology driven assistive healthcare, monitoring of elderly people), sports, security, logistic support, location-based services, home automation etc.
